## Overall goal
Learn about commodities markets and demonstrate data analysis skills

## Learning Objective
1. Learning: About commodity storage contracts and how to get detailed data from external sources to provide granular insights.

2. Applying: Your learning by writing a program (code) that can take a specific date and, based on its analysis, provide a price estimate for that date, whether it's in the past or the future. This suggests you'll be dealing with historical data and potentially forecasting.
