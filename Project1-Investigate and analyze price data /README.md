# Investigate and analyze price data

## Overall goal
Learn about commodities markets and demonstrate data analysis skills

## Learning Objective
1. Learning: About commodity storage contracts and how to get detailed data from external sources to provide granular insights.

2. Applying: Your learning by writing a program (code) that can take a specific date and, based on its analysis, provide a price estimate for that date, whether it's in the past or the future. This suggests you'll be dealing with historical data and potentially forecasting.

## Pre-requisits for this project (From Gemini)

1. Theoretical Understanding:
- Commodities Markets Basics: Fundamental knowledge of how commodity markets operate, including supply and demand factors.
- Commodity Storage Contracts: An understanding of what these contracts entail, how they affect pricing, and any relevant terms or conditions.
- Data Extrapolation Concepts: Knowledge of methods and principles used to estimate future or past values based on existing data.
- Granular Insights: Understanding how to derive detailed and specific information from data.

2. Data Access and Sources:
- Historical Commodity Price Data: You will need access to a dataset containing historical prices for the commodity you are analyzing. This data should ideally include dates and corresponding prices.
- External Data Feeds: If the task requires it, knowledge of how to access and retrieve data from external APIs or data sources (e.g., financial data providers, government statistics).

3. Technical Tools & Environment:
- A Programming Language: The task explicitly asks you to "Write code," so you'll need a suitable language for data analysis (e.g., Python, R, Julia).
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or Code Editor: A software application to write, test, and debug your code (e.g., VS Code, Jupyter Notebooks, PyCharm, RStudio).
- Relevant Libraries/Packages: Depending on your chosen programming language, you'll need libraries for:
    - Data manipulation and analysis (e.g., pandas for Python).
    - Numerical operations (e.g., NumPy for Python).
    - Potentially statistical modeling or forecasting (if estimating future prices requires more than simple extrapolation).

4. Skills:
- Data Acquisition Skills: Ability to retrieve data from various sources (files, databases, APIs).
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Skills to handle missing values, outliers, and format data correctly.
- Data Analysis Skills: Ability to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
- Coding Skills: Proficiency in the chosen programming language to implement the data analysis and price estimation logic.
- Algorithmic Thinking: Ability to design a logical sequence of steps to take a date input and produce a price output.
- Problem-Solving: The ability to troubleshoot issues and refine your approach.

5. Deliverables:
- Working Code: The primary output will be a functional piece of code that accepts a date as input and returns a price estimate.
- (Optional but Recommended) Code Documentation: Comments within your code explaining its logic, and potentially a separate README file describing how to run and use your solution.
